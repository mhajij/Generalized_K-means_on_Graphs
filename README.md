# Generalized k-means on Graphs
Generalized K-means on graph is an algorithm that utilizes centrality measures such as PageRank, harmonic centrality, etc to obtain a k-means-like clustering algorithm on directed and undirected graphs. The algorithm is generable and is applicable to graphs, meshes, point clouds and even metric spaces.

The details of the algorithm are described in the paper :

## Description of the script

The script demonstrated here can be applied to obtain cluster graphs as well as point clouds.

## Package Requirement

* NetworkX >= 2.0 (Based Graph library)
* scikit-learn >= 0.23.2
* NumPy 

## Getting Started : detecting communities in a complex network 

```ruby
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from graphkmeans import GraphKMeans

# (1) define the graph
G = nx.random_geometric_graph(350, 0.115)

# (2) Run the clustering algorithm
graph_k_means=GraphKMeans(G,k=4,n_iter=10,centrality_method="page_rank")               
d=graph_k_means.fit() # returns a dictionary with keys are nodes of the graph, values are id of the clusters

# (3) plot to inspect the clustering results
draw=graph_parition_plot(G,d)    
draw.draw_graph_partition()

```


### Getting Started : centrality measure-based point clouds clustering

```ruby
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets

from graphkmeans import GraphKMeansOnPointCloud

# (1) define the point cloud

n_samples=700
noise=0.06

X,_ = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=n_samples, noise=noise,factor=.5)  

# (2) Run the clustering algorithm

PCKM=GraphKMeansOnPointCloud(X,k=2,neighbors=5)  
d=PCKM.fit()

# (3) plot to inspect the results

plot_point_cloud(X,d)
```



### Using the script for graph clustering 

The algorithm can be utilized to obtain cluster on a given graph. Two main arguments are assumed : the input graph G and the number of cluster k. The following is an example.

```ruby
python main_graphkmeans.py -G graph_example.graph -k 4
```

### Using the script for centrality measure-based point clouds clustering

The algorithm can be utlized to obtain a clustering algorithm for point cloud. For instance the following computes the algorithm on 2 centric circles dataset with k=2 and default centrality measure set to PageRank.  

```ruby
python main_pointcloud.py -pc circles.npy -k 2 -nbrs 5 
```

Utilizing PageRank as the centrality measure subroutine is fast but it can lead to sub-optimal clustering results. If qualtiy of clusters are disrable then other centrality measures such as harmonic centrality are recommended. The script supports many centrality measures. For instance one can specify harmonic centrality on the moon dataset:  


```ruby
main_pointcloud.py -pc moon.npy -k 2 -nbrs 5 -c harmonic_centrality
```
