# Generalized_K-means_on_Graphs
Generalized K-means on graph is an algorithm that utilizes centrality measures such as PageRank, harmonic centrality, etc to obtain k-means clustering algorithm to directed and undirected graphs. 

The script demonstrated here can be applied to obtain cluster graphs as well as point clouds.
